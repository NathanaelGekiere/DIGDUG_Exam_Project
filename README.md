# Dig Dug Exam Project

## Introduction

For my Programming 4 project exam in DAE Howest I had to make an engine and a game based on a project our teacher gave us. The game I had to reproduce was Dig Dug.
I started to late on it thus I don't really have anything that's implemented and really working.
The project on which we had to base our engine was Minigin, made by our teacher.
